	abstractnote = {A century ago, Einstein formulated his elegant and elaborate theory of General Relativity, which has so far withstood a multitude of empirical tests with remarkable success. Notwithstanding the triumphs of Einstein’s theory, the tenacious challenges of modern cosmology and of particle physics have motivated the exploration of further generalised theories of spacetime. Even though Einstein’s interpretation of gravity in terms of the curvature of spacetime is commonly adopted, the assignment of geometrical concepts to gravity is ambiguous because General Relativity allows three entirely diﬀerent, but equivalent approaches of which Einstein’s interpretation is only one. From a ﬁeld-theoretical perspective, however, the construction of a consistent theory for a Lorentz-invariant massless spin-2 particle uniquely leads to General Relativity. Keeping Lorentz invariance then implies that any modiﬁcation of General Relativity will inevitably introduce additional propagating degrees of freedom into the gravity sector. Adopting this perspective, we will review the recent progress in constructing consistent ﬁeld theories of gravity based on additional scalar, vector and tensor ﬁelds. Within this conceptual framework, we will discuss theories with Galileons, with Lagrange densities as constructed by Horndeski and beyond, extended to DHOST interactions, or containing generalized Proca ﬁelds and extensions thereof, or several Proca ﬁelds, as well as bigravity theories and scalar-vector-tensor theories. We will review the motivation of their inception, diﬀerent formulations, and essential results obtained within these classes of theories together with their empirical viability.},

Starting with a ﬂat space-time we show that for a special choice of the coeﬃcients of the self-interactions the ghost-like pathologies disappear. For this we use the degeneracy condition of the Hessian. This constitutes the Galileon-type generalization of the Proca action with only three propagating physical degrees of freedom. The longitudinal mode of the vector ﬁeld is associated to the usual Galileon interactions for a speciﬁc choice of the overall functions. In diﬀerence to a scalar Galileon theory, the generalized Proca ﬁeld has more free parameters and purely intrinsic vector interactions. We then extend this analysis to a curved background. The resulting theory is the Horndeski Proca action with second order equations of motion on curved space-times.},

We examine the cosmological parameters in the model by using the data sets of CMB and CMB+HST, respectively. In particular, the Hubble constant is found to be H0=71.80−0.72+1.07 (72.48−0.60+0.72) kms−1Mpc−1 at 68% C.L. with CMB (CMB+HST), which would alleviate the Hubble constant tension. We also obtain that the reduced χ2 values in our model are close to unity when fitting with CMB and CMB+HST, illustrating that our model is a good candidate to describe the cosmological evolutions of the universe.}
