  While numerical simulations offer unparalleled precision
  and robustness in studying complex phys-

  ical systems, their execution is often hindered by
  complexity, costliness, and time consumption due

  to the intricate equations involved. This challenge is
  already encountered in General Relativity,

  where non-flat spacetimes exacerbate the computational
  burden. This complexity is further in-

  tensified when dealing with additional degrees of freedom.
  To address this challenge head-on, we

  introduce GRBoondi , a groundbreaking fixed-background
  numerical relativity code designed to pro-

  vide a unified interface for numerically solving
  Generalized Proca theories. GRBoondi grants users

  the ability to make arbitrary modifications to the Proca
  equations of motion on any background,

  providing a robust and versatile tool for exploring
  diverse classes of Generalized Proca theories.

  This letter serves as part of the submission of GRBoondi
  to the Journal of Open Source Software.
